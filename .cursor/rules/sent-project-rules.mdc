# Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
 - Avoid files over 1500 lines of code. Refactor at that point
